            <h3>From a Seattle basement to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</h3>
            <p>
              Pearl Jam came into being in Seattle in 1990 when Gossard and
              Ament of the glam-influenced rock combo Mother Love Bone decided
              to form a new band following the death of their group’s lead
              singer, Andrew Wood.
            </p>
            <p>
              The band was originally named Mookie Blaylock, after a
              professional basketball player, but the group settled on the words
              pearl and jam separately—the latter reportedly after seeing
              musician Neil Young in concert and admiring his “jam session”
              style.

                co-written by Vedder, guitarist Stone Gossard, and bassist Jeff

                the band's debut album, Ten.

              <h4>I am Mine</h4>
              <p>
                "I Am Mine" was written by vocalist Eddie Vedder in a hotel room
                near Virginia Beach, before the band's first show after the
                Roskilde tragedy in 2000. Vedder said that he wrote the song to
                "reassure myself that this is going to be all right."

                Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time...<br />

              <h4>Dance of the clairvoyants</h4>
              <p>
                "'Dance' was a perfect storm of experimentation and real
                collaboration, mixing up the instrumentation and building a
                great song, and Ed writing some of my favorite words yet, around
                Matt's killer drum pattern."
